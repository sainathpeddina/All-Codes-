primitive data types and reference (or non-primitive) data types. Here's a detailed explanation of both:

1. Primitive Data Types
These are the most basic data types that hold simple values and are predefined by Java. They are not objects and are stored directly in memory.
Immutable for some types (like boolean, char)

There are 8 primitive data types in Java:
| **Data Type** | **Size**                      | **Range**                                                   | **Default Value** | **Use Case**                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **byte**      | 1 byte (8 bits)               | -128 to 127                                                 | 0                 | Used for memory optimization in large arrays, file handling, networking.                       |
| **short**     | 2 bytes (16 bits)             | -32,768 to 32,767                                           | 0                 | Suitable for saving memory when working with large datasets (e.g., image processing).          |
| **int**       | 4 bytes (32 bits)             | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                             | 0                 | Commonly used for general-purpose integer values (e.g., counters, loops).                      |
| **long**      | 8 bytes (64 bits)             | -2^63 to 2^63 - 1                                           | 0L                | Used for very large integer values (e.g., timestamps, large counters).                         |
| **float**     | 4 bytes (32 bits)             | Approx. ±3.40282347E+38F (6-7 significant digits)           | 0.0f              | Used for floating-point numbers with less precision (e.g., scientific calculations, graphics). |
| **double**    | 8 bytes (64 bits)             | Approx. ±1.7976931348623157E+308 (15-16 significant digits) | 0.0d              | Used for high-precision floating-point numbers (e.g., financial and scientific computations).  |
| **char**      | 2 bytes (16 bits, Unicode)    | 0 to 65,535 (Unicode characters)                            | '\u0000'          | Stores single characters (e.g., letters, symbols).                                             |
| **boolean**   | Not precisely defined (1 bit) | true or false                                               | false             | Represents logical values for decision-making (e.g., true/false conditions).                   |

2. Reference (Non-Primitive) Data Types
Reference data types refer to objects and arrays. They are called "reference" types because they store the memory address (reference) of the data rather than the data itself.
These data types are not predefined in Java and are created using classes or arrays.
Can be mutable (e.g., fields in objects)

a. String:
A special class in Java for handling sequences of characters.
Use case: Used for storing and manipulating text. Strings are immutable in Java (once created, they cannot be modified).

b. Arrays:
Arrays are objects in Java used to store multiple values of the same data type.
Use case: Used when you need to store a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type (e.g., a list of integers or strings).

c. Classes and Objects:
Custom data types created using the class keyword. A class defines a blueprint for objects, which can hold both data (fields) and methods (functions).
Use case: Used when you want to create complex data structures like objects that combine properties and behaviors (e.g., creating an object of type Car with properties like color, model, and methods like drive()).

d. Interfaces:
An interface in Java defines a contract for classes to implement. It can contain abstract methods (without implementation) and default methods (with implementation).
Use case: Used to represent a contract for what a class can do without specifying how it should do it, which is useful for defining APIs.

Summary
Primitive data types are simple, fixed-size, and contain direct values. They are efficient in terms of performance and memory usage.a default value (e.g., 0, false)
Reference data types represent objects or collections of data, and they are more flexible but come with overhead due to memory storage and the need for garbage collection.null (not initialized)
